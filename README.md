🧭 1. PLANNER AGENT
   - Interprets intent (ROAS / CTR / Creative issue)
   - Generates 6-stage execution plan
   - Defines dependency graph (T1 → T2 → T3/T4 → T5 → T6)

Tasks it emits:
  T1 → Data Load / Summary
  T2 → Insight Generation
  T3 → Metric Evaluation
  T4 → Creative Health Score Evaluation (CHS)
  T5 → Creative Recommendation Generation
  T6 → Final Aggregation + Output Packaging

T1 ──▶ 🗄 2. DATA AGENT
        - Loads CSV
        - Aggregates spend/CTR/ROAS daily
        - Extracts top text terms
        - Computes creative repetition (fatigue)
        → output: data_summary.json

T2 ──▶ 🔍 3. INSIGHT AGENT
        - Compares recent vs previous windows
        - Detects CTR/ROAS movement
        - Produces hypotheses
        → output: hypotheses[]

T3 ──▶ 📊 4. METRIC EVALUATOR
        - Bootstrap ROAS significance
        - CTR proportion z-test
        → adds: metric_confidence, validated, effect_size%

T4 ──▶ 🎨 5. CREATIVE EVALUATOR (CHS)
        CHS = Behavior (0.5) + Text Quality (0.3) + Fatigue (0.2)
        - Measures creative stagnation
        - Scores weak components
        → adds: creative_confidence, chs_summary

T5 ──▶ 🧪 6. CREATIVE GENERATOR
        - Triggers only for low CTR or low CHS campaigns
        - Generates 3× creative variant styles:
              benefit-driven
              urgency-driven
              social-proof proofing
        - Each variant includes headline + message + CTA
        → output: creatives.json

T6 ──▶ 📦 7. AGGREGATOR
        final_confidence = weighted(metric + creative)
        produces:
          ✔ insights.json
          ✔ creatives.json
          ✔ report.md (human readable)
